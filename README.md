# Criminal-Hotspots-using-Clustering

Criminal activities have been increasing tremendously over the last 20-30 years. Hence security has become a major issue for people. Thus there is a need for the police department to take corrective actions efficiently to reduce criminal activities. To analyze the huge and diverse amount of Criminal data collected daily, clustering techniques are used. This data is stored in the criminal database
Spatial clustering algorithm are used. These algorithms help to identify the hotspots of criminal activities. Crime areas will be identified based on the reports of crime and actual occurrences of it as spatiotemporal data
We are using an optimization algorithm, HOT (Hotspot Optimization Tool) for spatial events visualization through searching, utilizing, and presenting related variable patterns of target event.
